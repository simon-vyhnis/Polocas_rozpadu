# JUIX
JUIX - Java Users Interface Xml is framework developed for easy to make java window apps. It is similar to android native development and it is fully customizable for your usage and completely free to use. 
You specify different <b>views</b> and put them into layouts. Your UI java code is structured to different Parts (alternative for android Activities).

<h2>Start guide</h2>
When you create your first project, there is already generated your first Part, layout and also Main class. You can run the main class and it will show a window with default layout.
In view package, you have basic views you can use and you can also create your own. Core, layouts and components are framework packages and would recommend you to not touch them.

! define your layouts in res/layouts, not in the layouts package!

Good luck, hope it will not suck as much as Swing does.
